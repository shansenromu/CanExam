\textnormal{\textit{ 
Experiments searching for Electric Dipole Moments (EDM) are stringent tests of beyond standard model physics, and provide new sources of CP-violation. This paper will discuss the motivation or EDM searches, how EDMs induce CP-violation, and how CP-violation contributes to baryogenesis. A discussion of how the physical observables relate to the the processes that generate the EDM will be presented. A review of the key theoretical topics necessary to understand the latest experimental techniques of the neutron EDM, $^{129}$Xe EDM and the $^{199}$Hg EDM experiments will be presented along with a description of the apparatus for each of these experiments.
